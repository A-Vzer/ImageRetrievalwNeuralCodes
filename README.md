# Image retrieval with neural codes

Implementation of: 
Mikolov, Tomas, et al. "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013.

This code is inspired from an assignment of the course '2IMM10 - Deep Learning' and is ported to PyTorch.
